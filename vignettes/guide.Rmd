# Purpose

`fbseqStudies` reproduces the results of academic studies of the methodology behind the `fbseq` and `fbseqCUDA` packages.

# System requirements

- Mac OS X or Linux. 
- R $\ge$ 3.2.0
- R packages `methods`, `parallel`, `snowfall`, `doMC`, `ggplot2`, `pracma`, `plyr`, `reshape2`, and `knitr`, available though the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- The R package `edgeR`, available through [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/). 
- R package `rstan`, the installation of which is explained on a [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
- A CUDA-enabled NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) with compute capability 2.0 or greater.
- CUDA version 6.0 or greater.
- The `fbseq` and `fbseqCUDA` packages, available on GitHub.

More information about CUDA is available through [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html). If your computer does not have these features, you can rent GPU time from [cloud computing enterprises](http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-cloud-computing-services.html) such as [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). See the installation vignettes for the `fbseq` and `fbseqCUDA` packages for installation details about those packages.

# Installation

## Option 1: install directly from GitHub.

For this option, you need the `devtools` packages, available from CRAN. Just open R and run 

```{r, eval=F}
library(devtools)
install_github("wlandau/fbseqStudies")
```

## Option 2: install from the source.

Open a command line program such as Terminal in Mac/Linux and enter the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:wlandau/fbseqStudies.git
R CMD build fbseqStudies
R CMD INSTALL fbseqStudies_0.0.tar.gz
```


Note: in `R CMD INSTALL fbseqStudies_0.0.tar.gz`, you may have to replace `fbseqStudies_0.0.tar.gz` by the name of whatever tarball comes out of `R CMD build`.

# Run the studies
